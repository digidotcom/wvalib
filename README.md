WVA Android Library
===================

The WVA Android Library (wvalib) is a Java library for interacting
with the web services of a Digi [Wireless Vehicle Bus Adapter][WVA]
(WVA).  This source has been contributed by
[Digi International][Digi].

  * Allows for reading vehicle data and diagnostic trouble codes over
    a vehicle's J1708 and CAN bus through polling or asynchronous
    subscription channels.

  * Assists in configuration of the WVA device.

Requirements
------------

You will need:

  * A Wireless Vehicle Bus Adapter

  * The Android SDK and dependencies must be installed with API level
    20.

  * An Android environment (device or emulation) to develop your
    application and run tests.

Installation
------------

Before you can build the library you must point to the location of the
Android SDK by setting your `ANDROID_HOME` environment variable or
creating a `local.properties` file and setting the `sdk.dir` property.

To import this library into an existing Android Gradle setup, add 
`compile 'com.digi.wva:wvalib:2.0+'` to your `build.gradle`.


Usage
-----

The library is a standard [Android Gradle Library Plugin][plugin]
project with all of the typical Gradle tasks. (assemble, check, build,
clean, â€¦).

Additional tasks added in `build.gradle`:

  - `generate<variant>Docs`: Process JavaDoc to HTML
  - `generate<variant>DocsJar`: Package documentation in a JAR
  - `generate<variant>SourceJar`: Package source in a JAR
  - `generate<variant>Jar`: Package class files in a JAR. This allows
    us to distribute a JAR rather than an AAR, as the library requires
    no Android resources.
  - `makeEclipseProject`: Create an Android project for import into
    Eclipse

High-Level Function Reference
-----------------------------

The API is documented through the use of JavaDoc documentation
comments. To get an HTML version of this documentation you can execute
the `generateReleaseDocs` Gradle task, which will place the HTML
documents under `wvalib/build/docs/javadocs`.
